This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and modified to run on Replit. Persistence is handled through the built-in Replit database.

## Overview
I built and deployed a next.js web app that connects to the Twitch API + a database to help keep track of favorite streamers. 

I utilized Twitch API to retrieve real streamer data (whether they are online or not, what game they're streaming, current status) in order to display them in reactive UI cards. Each card is hyperlinked to redirect to the actual twitch stream if the streamer is online!


## Technologies used
Twitch API, Next.js, React.js, Replit, ReplitDB
